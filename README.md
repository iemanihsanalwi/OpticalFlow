Mitigating cybersickness in VR through reduced visual cues. Optical flow analysis, game object identification, and geometric simplification techniques.

Welcome to the Cybersickness Mitigation Project!

This repository focuses on mitigating cybersickness in virtual reality (VR) experiences by reducing visual cues that can contribute to discomfort and motion sickness. The project aims to enhance the user's VR experience by implementing techniques to minimize self-motion cues and optimize visual perception.

Key Features:

    1. Optical Flow Analysis: The project incorporates optical flow analysis to assess the movement patterns within the VR environment. By analyzing the optical flow, we can identify areas with high visual motion and target them for further optimization.

    2. Game Object Identification: A game object identification mechanism has been developed to pinpoint objects with high optic flow. This enables targeted intervention to reduce visual cues in these specific areas, enhancing user comfort.

    3. Geometric Simplification: To mitigate cybersickness, the project explores techniques such as LOD (Level of Detail) simplification and mesh simplification. By reducing the complexity of the virtual scene, we aim to minimize self-motion cues and create a more visually comfortable VR experience.

    4. Comprehensive Documentation: The repository contains detailed documentation, including presentation slides, mathematical expressions related to optical flow, and research on cage mesh deformation. These resources aim to provide an in-depth understanding of the project's objectives, methodologies, and findings.
